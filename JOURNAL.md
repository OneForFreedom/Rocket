## Start!
Back for another week of cad! This time, I'm making a rocket! Or rockets. Right now, I'm planning on making a space shuttle! It'll be super cool. But before i even work on that, I wanna make a cartoony rocket! This week is gonna be a BLAST! (heh, get it?)

## The Body. 
I did this relatively quick, as i just made a sort of sketch, then just revolved the body!
