## Start!
Back for another week of cad! This time, I'm making a rocket! Or rockets. Right now, I'm planning on making a space shuttle! It'll be super cool. But before i even work on that, I wanna make a cartoony rocket! This week is gonna be a BLAST! (heh, get it?)

## The Body. 
I did this relatively quick, as i just made a sort of sketch, then just revolved the body!

Here's an Image!

## Sketch
God this took me soo long to do. I finally did the sketch, now im off to extrude. I'm gonna be in a constant cycle of sketch and extrude and sketch and extrude.

## Finished initial extrudes!
I finished some of the initial extrudes and rocket boosters! This took me like 1 hour to do, the majority of the time went into the rocket boosters, god they were soo anoying to work out.

## WHAT?? HOW'D THE TIME FLY?
this should NOT take this long. The repetitive act of extruding and filleting prolly took the time. Although I did make quite a bit of progress, I might be now doing some work near the front :D
